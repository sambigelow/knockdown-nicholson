        <h2>Construction</h2>
        <h3>
          With $100 in lumber and two days, you can build this sturdy stowaway
          bench.
        </h3>
        <p>Many knockdown workbenches suffer from unfortunate compromises.</p>
        <p>
          Inexpensive commercial benches that can be knocked down for shipping
          use skimpy hardware and thin components to reduce shipping weight. The
          result is that the bench never feels sturdy. Plus, assembly usually
          takes a good hour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom knockdown benches, on the other hand, are generally sturdier,
          but they are usually too complex and take considerable time to set up.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, most knockdown workbenches are designed to be taken
          apart only when you move your household. When I designed this bench, I
          took pains to ensure it was as sturdy as a permanent bench, it could
          be assembled in about 10 minutes and you would need only one tool to
          do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The design here is an English-style workbench that’s sized for an
          apartment or small shop at 6′ long. It’s made from construction lumber
          and uses a basic crochet and holdfasts for workholding. As a result,
          the lumber bill for this bench is about $100. You’ll need four 2″ x
          12″ x 16′ boards and one 1″ x 10″ x 8′ board.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used yellow pine for this bench, but any heavy framing lumber will
          do, including fir, hemlock or even spruce.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hardware is another $75. The supplies list notes high-quality
          hardware from McMaster-Carr; you could easily save money by doing a
          little shopping or assembling the bench with hardware that is slower
          to bolt and un-bolt.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Raw Materials</h2>

        </figure>

        <p>
          The core of this workbench is ductile iron mounting plates that are
          threaded to receive cap screws. This hardware is easy to install and
          robust. The rest of the hardware is standard off-the-rack stuff from
          any hardware store.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter where you buy your lumber, make sure it has acclimated to
          your shop before you begin construction. This workbench is made up of
          flat panels, so having stable wood will make construction easier and
          will reduce any warping that comes with home-center softwoods.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I bring a new load of lumber into my shop, I cut it to rough
          length and sticker it. I have a moisture meter that tells me when the
          wood is at equilibrium. If you don’t have a moisture meter, wait a
          couple of weeks before building the bench. Also, if the end grain of
          any board feels cooler to the touch than its neighbors, then that
          board is still wet-ish and giving off moisture. So you might want to
          give that stick some more time to adjust.
        </p>
        <p>
          This workbench is made up of five major assemblies that bolt together:
          two end pieces, two aprons and a top. Each assembly needs some cutting
          and gluing. Let’s start by building the legs.
        </p>

        <h3>Glued Up Legs</h3>
        <p>
          The joinery for this workbench is mostly glue, screws and a few
          notches. All those joints are in the two end assemblies. Each end
          assembly consists of two legs made by face-gluing two boards together.
          The act of gluing these two boards together creates a notch for the
          bench’s aprons.
        </p>
        <p>
          So begin making the end assemblies by gluing the 51⁄2“-wide leg parts
          together for each of the four legs. If you don’t own clamps, glue and
          screw these parts together, then remove the screws after the glue has
          dried. If you own clamps, I recommend sprinking a pinch of dry sand on
          the wet layer of glue between the laminations to prevent the pieces
          from shifting during the clamping process.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the glue in the legs is drying, turn your attention to the
          aprons.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/03pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Four legs good. By gluing a short piece and a long piece together,
            you create a thick leg and the notch for the workbench’s apron.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Laminated Aprons</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/04pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Aprons at work. Here you can see the 2×12 apron glued to the 1×10
            interior piece. The legs will then butt against the 1×10.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Like the legs, the front and rear aprons of the workbench are made by
          face-gluing two parts together to thicken the piece and create notches
          for the other assemblies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each apron consists of a 2×12 glued to a smaller 1×10 piece. The 2×12
          is the exterior of the workbench. The 1×10 makes notches for the legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The length of the 1×10 is the distance between the left legs of the
          bench and the right legs. In this 6′ workbench, the 1×10 is 45″ long.
          If your bench is longer, make these parts longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glue and affix a 1×10 to its 2×12 – and make sure the smaller piece is
          centered on the length of the larger. I used glue and nails to put
          these parts together. Any combination of glue, screws and nails will
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the aprons are assembled, you can then clip the corners of the
          aprons if you like. The 45° corners are cut 4″ from the ends of each
          apron with a handsaw. The next step is to use the heavy-duty ductile
          hardware to bolt the legs and aprons together.
        </p>

        <h3>Hardware Install</h3>
        <figure>
          <img

          />
          <figcaption>
            Can’t miss. By drilling these holes while the pieces are together,
            you ensure they will mate up again.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Clamp a leg to one of the aprons, making sure the leg is snug against
          the notch created by the apron’s 1 x10. Now lay out and drill the
          counterbore for the washer and the clearance hole for the bolt’s
          shaft. The clearance hole should go all the way through the apron and
          leg. The counterbore should be deep enough to hold the head of the
          bolt, the washer and the lock washer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now lock the leg and apron together with the hardware. Thread the bolt
          through a lock washer and then a washer. Push the bolt through the
          clearance hole. Spin a ductile mounting plate onto the bolt on the
          other side.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/06pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Mounting plates. Here is how the mounting plates look when they are
            installed. First you tighten the bolts, then you screw the mounting
            plate down. This way you can’t miss.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Snug up the mounting plate, then tighten the nut with a socket wrench.
          Once both bolts are snugged up on the leg, you can permanently install
          the mounting plates with screws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Repeat this process with the other three legs. When you are done you
          will have two aprons with their legs attached.
        </p>

            Legs & aprons. With the legs and aprons bolted together, you can
            glue up the parts for the benchtop.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Beefy Benchtop</h3>
        <p>
          One of the downsides to many English workbenches is that the top is
          springy because it is thin or unsupported from below. The traditional
          solution was to add “bearers” under the benchtop.
        </p>
        <p>
          These cross members ran between the front apron to the rear apron. And
          while they do make the benchtop stouter, I have never liked these tops
          as much as I like a simple thick benchtop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top surface of the benchtop is made from 2x12s that have been
          edge-glued to create a flat panel. This benchtop is 221⁄2” wide
          because it is made from two 2x12s. You can make it narrower if you
          like – an 18″- to 20″-wide bench is stable enough for handwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glue up your two planks for your benchtop and cut the top to its
          finished width and length.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be tempting to glue on the second layer of 2×12 to make the
          benchtop its final thickness. Resist. It is easier to first attach the
          aprons, legs and thin top. Then, once you finish building the end
          assemblies, you will know the exact size of this second top piece and
          exactly where it will go without measuring.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/08pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Easy & accurate. I use aluminum angle pieces for winding sticks. I
            also use them as edge guides for my circular saw. Clamp the aluminum
            angle to your benchtop and make your cut.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Feet in the Air</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/09pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Leg up. With the bench temporarily assembled like this, you can fit
            the pieces between the legs so they match the space available.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This next step ensures that the end assemblies will be the correct
          size for the width of your top. Assemble the bench upside down on
          sawbenches. Clamp the aprons to the top and push things around until
          the legs are square to the underside of the top and the aprons line up
          with the top all around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have everything clamped as you like it, you can fit the
          pieces for the end assemblies that go between the front legs and the
          back legs. There is a top plate that is the same width as the legs,
          plus a top stretcher made from a 2×12 that fits between the front
          apron and the rear apron.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Can’t miss II. With the top plate between the legs, you can put each
            stretcher on with screws (skip the glue because this is a
            cross-grain construction).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Cut these pieces to fit. Then wedge the top plate pieces between the
          legs and screw the stretchers to the legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the top stretchers screwed to the legs, you can take the bench
          apart, then glue and screw the top plates in place. Don’t forget to
          glue the edge of the top plate to the face of the top stretcher. There
          is a lot of strength to be found there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last bit of work is to attach the lower stretchers to the legs.
          These stretchers are in a notch in each leg. Cut the notch with a
          handsaw and clear the waste with a chisel. Then screw and glue the
          lower stretchers into their notches.
        </p>
        <figure>

            An end, assembled. I know this is an odd construction, but it works.
            And once you see it, you’ll get it. Here you can see the finished
            end assembly with the lower stretcher ready for trimming and
            screwing.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Reassemble the bench’s base so you can get the top complete.</p>

        <h3>The Top (& Details)</h3>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/12pwm1115workbench.jpg"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Flat makes flat. If your bench base is twisted, your benchtop will
            be twisted. It pays to get all the base bits in the same plane.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          With the base assembled, level the top edges of the aprons and the end
          assemblies so they are coplanar – that’s the first step toward a flat
          benchtop.
        </p>
        <p>
          I dressed these parts with a jointer plane and block plane and checked
          my work with winding sticks and a straightedge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you put the top on the base, I recommend one little addition at
          this stage. I attached glue blocks – for the lack of a better word –
          to the aprons so the end assemblies would be captured. You can see in
          the photo above that I used an offcut from a 2×12 and oriented the
          grain sympathetically with the apron. This five-minute upgrade makes
          the bench easier to assemble and a bit stouter.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img

            Bench, flatten thyself. Traverse the underside of the benchtop with
            a jack plane to get the surface fairly true.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now you can flatten the underside of the benchtop by using the bench’s
          base for support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put the benchtop on the base and plane the underside of the top flat
          with a jack plane – don’t worry about flattening the top of the
          benchtop. A couple of F-style clamps on the bench base will keep the
          top in place during this operation.
        </p>

            Boring for strength. I put three bolts through each assembly. This
            keeps things flat. Yellow pine doesn’t move much, so I allowed for
            only a little expansion and contraction by making my clearance holes
            1⁄16″ larger than the diameter of my bolts.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Test your benchtop by flipping it over and showing it to the
          workbench’s base. When the two parts meet without any rocking, you are
          done. Clamp the benchtop in place with the worksurface facing up. Now
          install the bolts, washers and mounting plates through the top and the
          top plate of the end assemblies. Do this in the same way you attached
          the legs to the aprons.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img

          <figcaption>
            Overkill. After gluing and screwing the second benchtop piece in
            place I also clamped things together while the glue dried.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Now flip the assembled bench over. You now can see the precise hole
          where the second benchtop piece should go. Glue up a panel using 2×12
          material and cut it to fit that hole exactly. Glue and screw it to the
          underside of the benchtop. Then lift the workbench base off the
          benchtop and clamp the top pieces together for extra bonding power.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the glue is dry, use a block plane to bevel the mating surfaces
          so they will slide together easily during assembly.
        </p>

        <h3>Holes & Holding</h3>

            Apron holes. Here I’m drawing the diagonal lines for the holdfast
            holes in the aprons. Many people use wooden pegs in the aprons
            instead of holdfasts. Both solutions defy gravity just fine.
          </figcaption>

        <p>
          You just made a table. Now you need to make it a workbench. To do that
          you need to add three things: a crochet, a planing stop and holdfast
          holes. The holdfast holes restrain your work on the benchtop and front
          apron. The crochet is for edge planing. The planing stop is for lots
          of things. Let’s make the holdfast holes first.
        </p>
        <p>
          To lay out the holdfast holes on the aprons, draw two or three
          rectangles on the aprons between the positions of your bench legs. Two
          rectangles for a 6′ bench; three for an 8′ model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connect two corners of each rectangle with a diagonal line. Then use
          dividers to equally space six holes from corner to corner on the
          diagonal lines. Then divide the vertical ends of each rectangle into
          three using your dividers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drill 3⁄4“-diameter through-holes at each of these locations. These
          holes in the aprons are great for supporting work from below,
          especially when edge-planing or dovetailing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now lay out the holdfast holes on the benchtop. My preference is to
          have two rows of holdfast holes on the benchtop (you can always add
          more later). One row is about 3″ from the back edge of the benchtop.
          These should be spaced every 10″ to 16″ depending on the reach of your
          holdfast. Then make another row of holdfast holes about 6″ in front of
          your back row. These should be spaced similarly, but these holes
          should be offset from the first row, as shown in the drawings and
          photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be sure to drill some holdfast holes in the legs – both to store
          holdfasts and to support large work, such as passageway doors. Hold
          off on drilling any additional holdfast holes until you really need
          them.
        </p>

        <h3>The Planing Stop</h3>
        <figure>

            woodworker. Take your time in squaring up the walls.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The traditional planing stop is a workhorse. I push workpieces against
          it to saw them, plane them, stick moulding on them, you name it. The
          stop is a piece of dense wood (yellow pine is dense enough) that is
          friction-fit into a mortise in the benchtop.
        </p>
        <p>First make the mortise, then make the planing stop to fit.</p>
        <p>
          The mortise for the planing stop is right in front of the end assembly
          and typically 3″ or so in from the front edge of the benchtop. This
          planing stop is 21⁄2” x 21⁄2” x 12″ – a fairly traditional size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lay out the mortise on both faces of the benchtop. Then bore out most
          of the waste with a large-diameter bit. Finish the walls with a
          chisel. It pays to check the walls so they are perfectly square to the
          benchtop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then plane the planing stop until it is a tight fit in the mortise and
          it requires mallet blows to move it up and down. Some planing stops
          also have a toothy metal bit in the middle that helps restrain your
          work. You can add that later if you like. It can be a blacksmith-made
          stop, a piece of scrap metal screwed to the top of the planing stop or
          even a few nails that are driven through the stop so their tips poke
          out.
        </p>

        <h3>Le Crochet</h3>
        <figure>
          <img

            The hook. You can bolt your crochet on. Some early accounts indicate
            it was nailed on. You probably could get away with glue alone.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          For this workbench I decided to make a crochet that looks exactly like
          the one in Roubo’s “l’Art du menuisier.” But to be honest, I don’t
          think the shape matters much. I’ve used a lot of different shapes and
          they all seem to work fine as long as they are vaguely “hook-shaped.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I made this crochet from scraps. I glued them together, then shaped
          the hook on the band saw, finishing it up with rasps.
        </p>
        <p>
          I attached the crochet with two lag screws and one cap screw, which
          was backed by a ductile mounting plate. This allows me to remove the
          crochet from the apron. As you might notice in the illustration, and
          in the photo above, the crochet slightly interferes with one of the
          cap screws through the apron. You can avoid this by altering the shape
          of your crochet or moving the hole for the cap screw.
        </p>

        <h3>A Shelf if You Like</h3>
        <p>
          I always like having a shelf below my bench to store bench planes and
          other assemblies. I haven’t included the shelf in the calculation for
          buying materials, so you’ll need some extra wood and screws to get the
          job done.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shelf is simply a panel that rests on cleats that are glued and
          screwed to the lower stretchers of the end assemblies. You can also
          screw some battens to the underside (and/or top) of the shelf to help
          keep it flat.
        </p>
        <p>The only thing holding the shelf in place is gravity.</p>
        <h3>And Finish</h3>
        <p>
          You don’t want to make your bench too slippery, so stay away from film
          finishes (or French polish). I recommend using little or no finish.
          For most workbenches, I usually just add a coat of boiled linseed oil.
          You can use an equal blend of oil, varnish and mineral spirits or just
          leave the wood bare.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, this really is a remarkably sturdy bench. Most people who
          use it cannot even tell that it is designed to be knocked down. It is
          only after they notice the cap screws in the benchtop that they
          suspect anything.

        <h2>Viseless Workholding</h2>

        <p>
          You have probably used benches with vises your entire woodworking
          career. A face vise and tail vise are pretty much the way to go,
          right?
        </p>
        <p>Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
        <p>
          Once you get the hang of it, viseless workholding becomes very fast
          and can be liberating and fun. Many of these techniques are quite
          useful, even if you have a vise on your bench. I find them useful for
          the entry-level person on a budget as well as for the seasoned
          woodworker seeking to expand his or her options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s look at how to accomplish some of the more common tasks at a
          bench: planing faces, edges and ends of boards; crosscutting and
          ripping; and sawing a couple of joints.
        </p>

          />
          <figcaption>
            Face planing. Face planing is accomplished by using a planing stop
            in combination with either battens or a doe’s foot. A holdfast keeps
            the doe’s foot in place at the corner of the workpiece to push it
            against a toothed planing stop. The wedge under the workpiece corner
            keeps a high corner from rocking. Plane toward your stop and the
            battens, and don’t drag your plane on the return stroke, or the
            board will pull away from the stop. Flip the doe’s foot over if the
            angle is wrong for a holdfast hole.

          <figcaption>
            Edge planing. Here are two positions for edge planing: One board is
            in the crochet and supported by pegs (in holes in the apron) and a
            batten; the other is supported by the benchtop and held against the
            planing stop. If the pegs are too far apart, place a batten on the
            pegs and place the edge of your stock upon that. If the workpiece is
            narrow and flexes under the plane, or doesn’t reach above the
            benchtop with the pegs in their highest position, plane the board
            against the planing stop on the benchtop. If there are hollows under
            the board, place wedges in them to keep the board from flexing away
            from the plane. If the board tips over, you are not planing with
            even pressure. End grain can be planed in the same manner, but to
            avoid splintering, plane almost to the corner, then flip the
            workpiece and finish planing.

            the opposite corners, then square across the bottom. Cut the
            shoulders in the bench hook (or at the end of the bench using pegs
            and a holdfast).

            supported by two pegs in the apron’s holdfast holes. I like to take
            a scrap of stock the same thickness as the material being dovetailed
            and put it to one edge of the chop. I place my holdfast just to the
            inside of the scrap and give it a good whack. This will keep that
            end of the chop fixed so that I need only to loosen the other
            holdfast when changing out parts to be worked.
